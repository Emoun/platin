Tasks/Projects
==============

[Local FF Transformation]
  - Goal: flow-facts that only affect one function (or parts of the program) should be translated locally
  - Steps:
    + restrict eliminate_set to subproblem
    + transform flow facts locally
    + compute (overestimated) loop bounds from local information
  - Status: assigned to benedikt, 10% done

[Symbolic Flow Facts]
  - Goal: support flow-facts with symbolic RHS
  - Steps:
    + introduce symbolic domain for FF rhs
    + translate function arguments from bitcode to machine code
    + add aiT export for symbolic loop bounds
  - Depends:
    + [Local FF Transformation]

[Machine Descriptions]
  - Goal: allow to configure the target processor (in particular memories and caches)
  - Steps:
    + define a new section machine-description
    + architectures provide default machine-description if none is given for WCET analysis
    + export machine-description to aiT (standard I$,D$,scratchpad; access timing)

[Call Context-sensitive IPET]
  - Goal: allow use, transformation and elimination of call-context sensitive program information
  - Steps:
    + refactor IPET builder
    + builder for context-sensitive callgraph (using infeasibility information)
    + builder for context-sensitive IPET
    + combine context-free and context-sensitive models for elimination

[VCFG IPET]
  - Goal: enable use, transformation and elimination of loop context-sensitive program information
  - Steps:
    + add IPET builder for VCFG (instead of LLVM CFG)
    + combine LLVM CFG and VCFG for elimination
  - Depends:
    + [Call context-sensitive IPET]

[Stack Cache Analysis]
  - Goal: analyze stack cache
  - Steps (TODO: Alex Jordan)
  - Depends:
    + [Machine Descriptions]

[Method Cache Analysis]
  -- Goal: add method cache analysis to platin
  -- Steps:
      + Export subfunction information
      + find conflict-free scopes (functions)
      + extend IPET to incorporate M$ miss-cost (see JOP)
      + think about exporting to aiT
      + Improvement: use a scope graph with loop/regions
      + Improvement: compute precise cache usage using IPET (see JOP)
   -- Depends:
      + [Machine Descriptions]

[WCET Formulas]
  -- Port work on WCET formulas (WCET12)
  -- Steps: ?
  -- Depends
     + [Symbolic Flow Facts]
